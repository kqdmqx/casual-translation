# Top 6 errors novice machine learning engineers make

* 机器学习工程师新手常犯的六大错误

In machine learning, there are many ways to build a product or solution and each way assumes something different.
Many times, it’s not obvious how to navigate and identify which assumptions are reasonable.
People new to machine learning make mistakes, which in hindsight will often feel silly.
I’ve created a list of the top mistakes that novice machine learning engineers make. Hopefully, you can learn from these common errors and create more robust solutions that bring real value.

* 机器学习中解决同一个问题有多种方法；不同的方法基于不同的假设。
* 很多时候，选择假设、辨别假设是否合理不是件容易事。
* 新手经常犯一些事后想来比较傻的错误。
* 作者列举了新手机器学习工程师的常见错误。
